- Knowlegde based AI limitation.
For example, Cyc failed to understand a story
about a person named Fred shaving in the morning (Linde, 1992). Its inference
engine detected an inconsistency in the story: it knew that people do not have
electrical parts, but because Fred was holding an electric razor, it believed the
entity “FredWhileShaving” contained electrical parts. It therefore asked whether
Fred was still a person while he was shaving

- Machine Learning(ML): Is the capability for AI systems to extract patterns from raw data
- Deep Learning just a type of machine Learning but with a 'deeper' computational graph. Hust more nodes and layers
- Evolution of naming for DL: Cybernetics(1940s-1960s) ---> Connectionism(1980s-2000s) ---> Deep Learning(2006-...)
- Give 5000 labeled example to a Supervised DL and it can sucessfully recognize and assist. Give it 10 Million and it will outperform and replace you
