==========================NOTES===========================
- Always find ways to stabilize your functions before computing them. Stabilizing them involves finding tricks to avoid underflows and overflows
- Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010; Bastien et al., 2012) is an example of a software package that automatically detects and stabilizes many commonnumerically unstable expressions that arise in the context of deep learning.
- Main methods to optimise are: Gradient descent, Newtons method, KKT(Karush-Khun-Tucker) method for functions with constraints(Uses the Generalized Lagrangian )
- min(f(x)) = max(-f(x))
