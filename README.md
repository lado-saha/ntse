# **Ntsé**: My Deep Learning Journey

## By LADO SAHA

Welcome to my journey through the fascinating world of AI and deep learning, inspired by the seminal text [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

## The Ineffectiveness of Knowledge-Based Systems

Traditional knowledge-based systems, while powerful in their formal and rule-based structure, often fall short in handling the complexity and variability of real-world data. These systems rely heavily on predefined rules and human expertise, making them rigid and difficult to scale.

## The Advent of Deep Learning

Deep learning represents a paradigm shift, leveraging large datasets and neural networks to automatically learn and generalize patterns. This approach mimics the human brain's ability to learn from experience, enabling breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and beyond.
